### Publicity Material for the MSSC Process

The Modular Software Safety Case (MSSC) process takes advantage of the modularity in software designs when providing assurance of a safe system composed from these modules.

The same principles that are used in modularising software designs are applied to safety arguments. Modules in the safety assurance argument are defined that map onto design module(s) with well defined safety properties.

When systems are composed from these modules, there is a clearer understanding of the dependencies between the design modules and between the Safety Case Modules related to them.
